# UVa-online-judge solutions

In this repository I collect some solutions to problems that can be solved on [UVa online-judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php).

[uHunt](https://uhunt.onlinejudge.org/id/793541) is a nice statistics tool that can be used to get an overview and to pick new problems. Especially the "Competetive Programming" book has a nicely structured selection of problems.
